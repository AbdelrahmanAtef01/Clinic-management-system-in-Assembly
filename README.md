- **Doctor Mode**: Provides doctors with access to view patient records and today's reservations.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Admin Authentication**: Allows access to admin functions only after entering the correct password within three attempts.
- 📋 **Patient Record Management**: Add, edit, or update patient records, including viewing specific details based on patient ID.

## ⚙️ Modes

### 🛠️ Admin Mode

To access admin features, the user must enter the correct password within the first three attempts; otherwise, the system will block access. Admin mode provides the following options:

1. **Add New Patient**: Register new patients by entering their data and creating a unique ID.
2. **Edit Patient Record**: Modify existing patient records or add additional data using the patient’s unique ID.
3. **Reserve a Slot with the Doctor**: View all available slots and reserve a time slot for a patient based on their ID and desired appointment time.
4. **Cancel Reservation**: Cancel an existing reservation, making the slot available again for others.

### 🩺 Doctor Mode

In doctor mode, access to patient data and daily appointments is available without the need for password verification. Options include:

1. **View Patient Record**: View all stored data for a patient by entering their unique ID.
2. **View Today’s Reservations**: Display all scheduled appointments for the day, enabling quick access to daily reservations.
